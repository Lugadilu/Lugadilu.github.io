### Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF)
It enables penetration testers to perform client-side attacks using the target’s web browser. 
Pentesters use BeEF to “hook” web browsers. 
he attacker somehow makes a user execute a JavaScript file name hook.js to take control of the user’s browser and launch further attacks against the target system from within the browser context.

To launch it, run sudo beef-xss. IT opens a GUI , username beef and the password kali. or what you set

username beef and the password

Open a new tab in your Firefox browser and enter the fake URL that contains te hook.js line i.e  the URL http://127.0.0.1:3000/demos/butcher/index.html.

####  Using BeEF to Initiate a Social Engineering Attack
Click the Commands tab in the BeEF Control Panel. Scroll down to the Social Engineering category. Open the category. Select the Fake Notification Bar (Firefox) choice from the module list. The default URL for the malicious plug-in is listed along with the message that will be shown on the browser window. The exploit will cause an alert to display on the browser. If the user clicks the install button for the fake plug-in, they will be directed to the URL listed.

Change Plugin URL to http://10.6.6.13/. This URL redirects the user to the login screen for the DVWA virtual server. The URL can point to any webpage, either locally stored or on the network. In a live penetration testing environment, this would be a cloned website, a malicious application download, or a webpage containing a malicious script.
Change the alert text to say AdBlocker Security Extension is out of date. Install the new version now. Click Execute to send the alert to the hooked browser window.
Return to the browser tab that displays The Butcher fake web page. An alert message is on the Firefox banner area. Click the Install Plug-in button on the alert banner.

The risk is that The browser is hijacked and forced to go to what could be a malicious website that will download malware to the target computer.

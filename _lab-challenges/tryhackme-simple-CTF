### ðŸ§  Key Learnings

- **Enumeration:** Explored services using `nmap`, found hidden directories with `gobuster`.
- **Web Exploitation:** Practiced SQL injection, login bypass, and used Burp Suite for inspection.
- **Access & Privilege Escalation:** Captured both `user.txt` and `root.txt` flags via local enumeration techniques.
- **Tools Used:** `nmap`, `gobuster`, `hydra`, `linpeas`, and `suid3num`.

### ðŸ’¡ Personal Notes

This CTF was part of my practical training in real-world attack simulation. It sharpened my ability to chain vulnerabilities and navigate file systems under restrictive permissions.
